            <h3>Kai</h3>
            <p>Kai is an 8-year-old   boy who has not lived an easy life on the street. When we found him, he had difficulty walking. As a precaution, we had his hips x-rayed and there are no signs of dysplasia. Upon further examination, we found he has some arthritis in his lower spine and we currently have him taking joint supplements.</p>
            <p>Kai is big and strong with a confident personality. He does not enjoy the company of other dogs - just can't be bothered with giving them the time of day. No small children for Kai as he prefers an adult home.</p>
            <p>Kai is looking for a home of his very own. He knows he is a good -looking guy and believes he is the only dog you need. He is happy to sit by your side and let you tell him just how handsome he is! Better yet, he is more than willing to pose for your Instagram or Facebook page - we bet he'll be an instant success!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Raven is a 7-year-old girl who was brought to us. Her original owner had died, and the next family she had was unable to afford to keep her.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Raven is housebroken an&nbsp;enjoys being the only dog in her owner's life. She does not like small dogs or cats. She would do well in a home with older children and adults, but no small children.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Raven knows her commands and is doing great with her follow-up training. She is even learning new things and is slowly coming along. We are proud of her progress!</p>

            <h3>Happy</h3>
            <p>Happy is an 8-year-old boy who was a cute puppy when he went to his new home. As he grew into a larger dog, his family had less and less time for him. Gradually Happy was left without structure in his home and believed he needed to take charge. His family was unwilling to pay for a trainer to provide them with assistance.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Happy knows all  his commands, is housebroken and loves people. He prefers women over men and keeps an eye on his humans at all time. Small dogs are not on his list of things he likes, and he does not like aggressive dogs that give him attitude. He needs a home with no small dogs or cats.</p>
            <p>Happy likes to be by your side while you are working and will lay quietly at your feet. He likes to go for walks and loves exploring the park. He needs a loving home where he can succeed and be cared for.</p>

            <p>Dukester is a 9-year-old boy who lost his home when his owner became ill and could no longer care for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dukester is used to being the star of the show and does not get along with small dogs. He has a strong opinion of himself and will do best as the only dog in an adult home.  He is devoted to his person and can be protective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dukester is not a cuddly kind of guy, he is more of a quiet, hang out by your side kind of guy. He knows his commands and walks easily on a leash. He is making strides in his training and needs an owner that is willing to continue to work with him.</p>

            <h3>Dodger</h3>
            <p>Dodger is a big, big, 6-year-old boy who was allowed to become obese in his former home. His previous owner did not provide him with exercise,  he came to us at 159 pounds. He is so large he can barely turn around in his kennel. This poor boy is so uncomfortable through no fault of his own.</p>
            <p>Dodger is now on an exercise regimen to help him slim down a bit. He is receiving a special, low calorie diet and we are providing him with healthy food and treats (such as carrot sticks and green beans). He is receiving walks and exercise in short periods, three times a day.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dodger needs to continue his diet and exercise regimen to become healthy and fit again. We will help his new owner every step of the way to ensure his success. He will need an adult home in which his new owner can dedicate themselves to Dodgers well-being and slowly progress his exercise as this is a slow process for him. He is a sweet, loving German and would make a wonderful, dedicated companion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Hoss</h3>
            <p>Hoss is a 3-year-old boy who tops the scales at 100 pounds. He was picked up as a stray and landed in a crowded shelter with little hope of a future. One of our volunteers found him and brought him to us.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hoss likes to go for walks but his enthusiasm for playing ball is his real passion. Show this boy a tennis ball and he is ready to go! Hoss is calm and happy until he saw someone playing fetch, then he will go over to see if he can play too! Hoss can get a bit too focused on his toys, so for that reason we recommend a home without children. At times he can be a bit too possessive of his toys, so we are working with him to learn to share.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hoss is a smart boy and will happily allow you to be the alpha of the pack but is always available to take over if he believes his pack needs a leader. This big boy is 100% German Shepherd!&nbsp;</p>
