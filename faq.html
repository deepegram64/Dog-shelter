            <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
            <p class="text-italic"> <em> As with all dogs, make sure you do a proper amount of research and get all the information you can before adopting a dog. One of the important things to keep in mind when adopting a dog is to find out more about the breed you're going to bring home. Depending on the breed of dog, the requirements in your home and life change.&nbsp;</em></p>

        <h3>German Shepherds are big dogs!</h3>
        <p> Most German Shepherds reach their full growth at 3 years of age, their weight and height may vary. Typically, females weigh 60-80 pounds and will reach a heigh of 22-24 inches. Males normally reach 70-100 pounds reaching a height of 24-26 inches. Much depends on genetics, nutrition, muscle,   exercise, how they were cared for by their previous owners, and how you will care for them. This combination combined with power and speed      in the wrong hands they can be a big handful, again each dog is different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">
        <h3>German Shepherds need training!</h3>
        <p> You may not know what sort of training or obedience experience the dog has had, if any. Some dogs have had little or no training, while others may be frightened and unsure of how to behave in a new environment. It can be a lot of work to train an older German Shepherd that has spent years living with a certain idea of what is permitted, through no fault of their own. It is never too late to train an older dog as long as the owner is dedicated, confident, open-minded and knowledgeable about training. It may take some adaptations of methods, patience, and consistency from the owner, but even an older dog can be trained and taught to obey new commands. The earlier you can begin to address any socialization and behavior issues, the sooner your dog will learn the new rules. &nbsp;One of the best resources available - regardless of age - is an obedience class. There, you can reinforce what your dog may already know and learn new commands - all while being surrounded by distractions from other adults/children and dogs. It is a great environment for learning because the dog needs to learn to focus on you! There are several resources that can help, with some offering group or one-on-one trainings. "Consistency is key" to any training, and positive reinforcement is the best method for training a German Shephard regardless of age. Unless you are prepared to train your dog, you should think about one of the hundreds of other breeds.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <h3>German Shepherds have lots of energy!&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Yes it is true, and just because you may adopt an older dog doesn't mean it's a couch potato! As with people, each one is different. Failure to properly exercise your dog will mean that your dog will start to demonstrate bad behaviors. This is one of the main reasons why people surrender their dogs. Working obedience with your dog on a daily basis (even the couch potato variety) and giving the dog a physical and mental work-out will direct the dogs energy and make for a much happier dog (and you!) A 10-minute "mind" work-out (basic house manners/obedience), playing in the backyard, walking to the mailbox or just going for a stroll/jog around the block can do wonders for behavior and releasing energy. Afterwards, many are ready to lay down and relax with the family. Others will need a longer and more focused workout each day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>German Shepherds have strong pack instincts!</h3>
        <p>This means that they need to be with their pack (you) in your home, not shut outside. They also need a strong and consistent leader (you). Otherwise they can take on the role of leading and correcting you and your family. This is one of the main reasons (aside from proper training) that German Shepherds have developed their aggressive or negative reputation. The dog was unlucky enough to be selected by an inexperienced owner who did not know about pack structure, leadership and boundaries.&nbsp; With time, you can expect the dog to follow you everywhere, lay where you are, never letting you get out of eye sight (including the restroom).&nbsp; Being a strong leader doesn't mean being loud, harsh or demanding but someone who is mature, calm, confident, firm and fair in all areas of treatment of the dog. Dogs in general, but especially German Shepherds, need leadership. By being a fair leader, you will earn their respect, trust, and undying loyalty.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">
        <h3>German Shepherds shed!</h3>
        <p>These dogs have a double-coat, brushing your dog a few times a week will cut down on finding hair in your carpet, furniture, and clothing. Twice a year they will 'blow' their coat, meaning they are shedding and you'll need to vacuum several times a week during this time. Expect hair to still be found throughout most of your home and in places you may have missed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">
        <h3>German Shepherds are very smart!</h3>
        <p>This is one of the things people who select this breed love about them. This is why they are such a versatile breed, excelling in obedience, herding, retrieving, agility or service work. Just because you select an older dog doesn't mean they still don't look for a job and have a need to work - it's in their DNA! Without it, a bored German Shepherd can become frustrated and potentially destructive. This is the reason German Shepherds are one of the hardest breeds to own and one of the best breeds of all. Their loyalty, intelligence and strong pack instincts make them a very unique breed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">
        <h3>Lastly...</h3>
        <p>Everyone who gets a German Shepherd starts off with good intentions, but don't often think through what it actually means to be an 'owner' of this breed. If after doing research, talking to trainers and fully&nbsp;understanding what being an 'owner' of this dog means - there is nothing wrong with reconsidering and getting a different breed of dog. You need to make the best choice for you and your family. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>BUT - if you have the energy, time, and patience to work with one of these dogs - a German Shepherd is one of the best breeds to have!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
