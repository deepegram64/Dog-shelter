            <h3>This is Sammy.&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;How did we come to be? Our story is quite simple, really.</p>
<p>Our daughter has always had a love for animals and started volunteering in a local no-kill shelter (dogs &amp; cats). She loved everything about the job, but most importantly the quality of time she was able to spend with the animals.</p>
<p>We were her transportation, and upon picking her up we would take a tour&nbsp;of the dogs that were there. She knew all their stories, would tell us which ones went for a walk and how well they did, how many visitors went in to interact with which dog, which ones were being adopted, and which ones were brought back.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
            <p> We became familiar with them too and couldn't believe some of their stories. People can be cruel: a dog was hit by a car and the owner dropped it off because it was 'damaged', or a few had limbs that needed to&nbsp; be amputated because of a scratch or cut that got infected and the owner didn't want a vet bill. As my grandmother used to say "<em>...some people don't deserve dogs, what they do to a dog should be done to them...</em>".</p>
            <p>But what struck us the most was how many older dogs there were:&nbsp;overweight dogs that developed kidney issues, dogs that were up in age dealing with incontinence,  dogs with joint issues that had difficulty walking. There were a few times older dogs were in pairs and the shelter didn't want them separated as they've been together for years.              People wanted to adopt one but not the other and they needed to be together.&nbsp; The sad truth was, as a dog got older and needed more care, the owner didn't want to deal with it. Whether it was because it was easier to give it away than to be with it until the end or because they didn't want the responsibility of an older dog.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p> There was no way we could take care of a huge number of dogs, but a few? Why couldn't we, in their golden years, give them a secure, loving home until a 'forever' home is found? Isn't offering to help a few better than none?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dogs provide unconditional love and deserve to be given love back - shouldn't that be reason enough to do it?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Sammy was our first dog, he is 5 years old, he is everything we've expected a German Shepherd to be and more. Someone once said, "always be training" and with this breed I can honestly say it is true! He has blessed our family in ways that words cannot truly describe. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;We consider our home "Sammy's House" and all dogs who enter are his guests. He provides them a warm place to lay their head and eat their meals, kinship, a stroll in nature, and shares his humans with them. He knows  they are only staying for a while until they go to their new home, and another dog who needs him will take their place.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
